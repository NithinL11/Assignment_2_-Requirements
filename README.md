# Assignment 2: AI Training Data Requirements


## Scenario
The client, an AI developer, uses web scraping to collect training data but faces some challenges:

1.Separating questions from answers to prevent AI from memorizing responses.
2.Ensuring balanced datasets to improve AI fairness and accuracy.

---

###Requirement 1:
 
As an AI developer, I want training questions to be categorized separately from answers so that AI models can be tested without being biased by pre-exposed answers.


###Assumptions & Validation:

-The current dataset does not separate questions from answers.

Method 1: Interview developers to determine if pre-exposed answers cause overfitting issues.

-Developers need access to questions only to prevent AI from memorizing answers.

Method 2: Analyze the current dataset structure to identify whether questions and answers are mixed.
Method 3: Test AI models with and without pre-exposed answers and compare performance metrics.

-A relational database will help structure and retrieve data efficiently.

Method 4: Review past AI model predictions for potential bias trends.
Method 5: Gather feedback from developers about their experiences with biased AI outputs.
Method 6: Conduct statistical analysis on dataset distribution to check for imbalances.


###Follow-up questions

-Have developers already implemented any manual workarounds to prevent AI from memorizing answers?

-What percentage of training data is affected by mixed question-answer formats?

-How much accurate improvement is expected after separating questions from answers?

-What statistical tools or techniques will be used to identify dataset imbalances?

-Were past AI models trained with mixed question-answer data, and if so, what biases were observed?

-What difficulties have developers faced in training unbiased AI models?


###Preliminary Tasks:
-Identify storage issues by analyzing the current dataset.

-Confirm developer workflows through interviews.

-Design a relational database schema for structured storage.

-Develop an API to retrieve only questions while restricting answer access.

-Implement a manual tagging system to categorize questions.

-Evaluate the systemâ€™s impact on AI model validation.


###Requirement 2: 
As an AI developer, I want to ensure that my training data is unbiased so that the AI model can make fair and accurate predictions.

###Assumptions & Validation:
-Bias exists due to overrepresentation or underrepresentation of certain data.
Method 1. Review past AI model predictions for biased trends.

-Developers need an automated bias detection system to identify and correct imbalances before AI model training.
Method 2. Run statistical analysis on dataset distribution.

-Statistical analysis is the best way to quantify bias.
Method 3. Gather developer feedback on biased AI outputs.

###Follow-up Questions:
-What types of biases have been observed in past training data?

-How frequently do developers encounter bias-related issues in AI outputs?

-What tools or methods are currently used to detect bias in AI training data?

-How does bias affect the overall accuracy and fairness of AI models?

-What statistical techniques are most effective for bias detection?



###Preliminary Tasks:
-Collect past AI training results and analyze bias patterns.

-Implement a bias detection algorithm to flag issues.

-Develop a bias report generator with visual insights.

-Create a user dashboard for viewing bias metrics.

-Test and refine the bias detection model.
